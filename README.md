#after collision detect with everything done, do 
smooth collision detection, to slowly push entities away from eachother

todo
perfect collision detection

Make collision detection have a predicted position to move entities to, then take average of all entities and move

bounciness for entities

transfer momentum based on weight and bounciness (almost done -bounciness)

include bounciness in coll detec

calculate collision detection based on size, inertia, and position instead of just inertia and position

eventually include friction
